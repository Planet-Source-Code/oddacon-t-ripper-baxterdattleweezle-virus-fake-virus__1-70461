### Description

scare any friends or someone who needs a good scare! The program does not delete any files and does no other harm then disabling task manager and the mouse. Includes a DOS prompt popup The program stays ontop and after a duration of time you recieve a msgbox that enables the task manager and mouse and ends the program restoring everything. Just for fun, to humiliate someone or get a good laugh or reaction, hehe =)
 
### More Info
 
Dirs.txt is the only input i think. which is a directory listing for the baxterdattleweezle virus. The DOS prompt if you want to call it a input but its in its own module.

if you try and use the program full-screen it will have an error if you have a different resolution screen size, i mean the fire will be in the middle of the program insted of where it should be. i hope you undertsand why this program is a window and not full screen, write me if you have a better way, i know i could imorove but its impressive i believe.

no saving a file or anything, no returns.

probabbly many
